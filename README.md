# Anomaly-Prediction-in-sensor-data

**Objective:** The objective was to predict anomaly based on the readings captured by sensors.
Data is captured from various sensors from a energy manufacturing plant on specific time intervals.

**Columns :**
{'Date': datetime64[ns],
'X1' : reading from sensor one,
'X2' : reading from sensor two,
'X3' : reading from sensor three,
'X4' : reading from sensor four,
'X5' : reading from sensor five,
'target' : Anomaly(0 or 1) }

**Models implemented:**   Classical models- Logistic regression, KNN, Decision trees, SVM; 
                          Advanced models- RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
